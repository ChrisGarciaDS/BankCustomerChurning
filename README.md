This research project is to look into the behavior of bank customers, both past and present to predict whether a customer will close their bank account. The data set was selected from Kaggle containing 10,000 observations and 14 variables of customer behavior: ‘RowNumber’, ‘CustomerId’, ‘Surname’, ‘CreditScore’, ‘Geography’, ‘Gender’, ‘Age’, ‘Tenure’, ‘Balance’, ‘NumOfProducts’, ‘HasCrCard’,  ‘IsActiveMember’, ‘EstimatedSalary’, and ‘Exited’. The objective of this study is to create a binary classification analysis to determine whether or not a bank customer will exit. Initially, a baseline model using Logistic Regression was created followed by Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Perceptron, and Neural Network. After a detailed analysis of the data set, the neural network model had the best results. Future discussion explains in further detail the data itself.
